# spotifyBarRaceChart

App that track you spotify data can only access a certain time frame. This means all-time ranking are often inaccurate or downright omitting important artists from your past. The solution is to download yourself your extended streaming history from the spotify website under the "privacy" tab.  
However, i did not find free, easy to access options to automatically parse those files. I did it myself, and added the possibility to get a custom playlist of any era of your spotify account.
